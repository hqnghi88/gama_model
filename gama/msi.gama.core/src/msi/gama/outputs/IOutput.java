 * information on a concrete support, only computing it. They however control whatever concrete support they represent
 * (opening, closing, pausing, updating and refreshing it).
 *
 * @update Since 2018, the role of ouputs in the computation has been reduced, so as to not weigh too much on the
 *         simulation thread. More computations are now taken in charge by the concrete implementations of the output
