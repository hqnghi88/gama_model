	 *            monitors, for instance. This validator, although it has access to the whole description, is not
	 *            supposed to modify it, especially because the validation of the other expressions and children of this
	 *            description can be incomplete
	 * @param emfContext
	 *            The underlying emf object corresponding to this operator. Note that it is not always known (in which
	 *            case it is null), notably when the statement is synthetic. It is strictly forbidden to modify it.
	 * @param arguments
	 *            the array of expressions corresponding to the arguments of the operator. None are null, but the size
	 *            of the array will depend on the operator
	 * @return true if the operator is considered as valid (even when informations and warnings are produced during the
	 *         validation), false otherwise. In that case, it is better to produce meaningful errors before.
